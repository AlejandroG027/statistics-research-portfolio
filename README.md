# Multivariate Linear Analysis of US Crime Rates

## Breif Overview

This report investigates factors influencing crime present in 400 US cities. Using a multivariate, partially categorical, linear regression model, this report provides insight as to what variables could potentially predict the prevalence of crime.

- R was the main language used to conduct this report (tidyverse, GGplot2, kableExtra)

## Below provides a peak at what is contiained within this report

1. Faceted Scatterplot Visualizations from Crime Rates and possible explanatory variables

3. Data Transformations to ensure validity conditions are met
4. Lack of Fit Tests for model verification
5. Fitting a multivariate linear regression model, intepretations of model equasion, and evaluation of chosen model
6. Verification of Absence of Multicollinearity
7. Statistical Inference using Model Utility Tests and Partial F-Tests
8. Predictive Condifidence and Prediction Intervals
9. Model Validation using MSPE and MSE
10. Explanation of the successes and failures of our fitted model relative to the observed data
